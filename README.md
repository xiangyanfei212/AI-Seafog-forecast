# AI-Seafog-forecast

## Brief Description

Accurate and timely prediction of sea fog is very important for activities related to maritime and coastal economies. However, traditional methods based on numerical and statistical methods often struggle because sea fog is complex and unpredictable. In this study, we aimed to develop a smart machine learning method to predict sea fog. We focused on the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) coastal area as an example.  We present a novel approach for predicting sea fog by utilizing the output from a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. We used a technique named time-lagged correlation analysis (TLCA) to determine the important factors causing sea fog. We also used ensemble learning and a special method named the focal loss function to handle situations where there is an imbalance between the fog and fog-free data. To test how accurate our method is, we used data from weather stations and historical forecasts over one year. Our machine learning approach performed better than two other methods—the weather research and forecasting nonhydrostatic mesoscale model (WRF-NMM) and the method developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL)—in predicting sea fog. Specifically, regarding predicting sea fog 60 hours in advance with a visibility of 1 kilometer or less, our method achieved better results by increasing the chances of detecting sea fog while reducing false alarms.
